# Mapty project

## Project Description

This project is a simple web application that allows users to log their workouts and track them on a map. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application uses the Geolocation API to track the user's location and display it on a map. The user can log their workouts by entering the type of workout, distance, duration, and location. The application uses the Leaflet library to display the map and the Mapbox API to provide the map tiles. The user can view their workouts on the map and filter them by workout type. The application also uses local storage to store the user's workouts so they can be viewed later. The application is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
